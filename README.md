# BlockBandedMatrices.jl
A placeholder package for `BlockBandedMatrix` and `BandedBlockBandedMatrix`, which is currently in ApproxFun though maybe copied over to a separate package.

A `BlockBandedMatrix` represents a block banded matrix: a block matrix with only finite number of blocks near the diagonal nonzero.

A `BlockBandedBlockMatrix` represents a block banded matrix whose blocks are also banded.

Please file an issue if this package would be useful for you, and I will clean up and split out the relevant code from ApproxFun.
